This work focuses on the usage of H-Dipole antennas in THz-TDS systems. In the previous section, H-Dipoles were describes as suitable for THz-TDS. However, two main problems still remain. 

The main part of a H-Dipole antenna is made up of the two neighbouring electrodes with a photoconductive active region inbetween them. When the H-Dipole PCAs are used as emitters, the THz waves are supposed to be transmitted fro
\begin{itemize}
    \item depending on whether the PCAs are used as emitters or detectors, describe the wave coupling and the problem with coupling in the pads at low f 
    \item maybe even when using them as emitters still talk about the detection side because simulations have been done with detectors 
    \item somehow talk about ringing and the FFT 
\end{itemize}
