In order to reduce pad resonances the THz antennas have to be designed carefully. We use CST Microwave Studio to evaluate possible antenna configurations. CST Microwave Studio is a 3D EM field solving software. By means of finite element methods (FEM) CST Microwave Studio is used to calculate many different antenna properties. Particular interest lies in the radiation impedance, the surface current and the electromagnetic field distribution of the antenna. 

H-Dipole antennas with differing feed configurations are simulated. We present the results of these simulations. The simulation results are important for deciding on which feed configurations are processed.
