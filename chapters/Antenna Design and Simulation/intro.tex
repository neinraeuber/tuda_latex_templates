The central idea of this thesis, introducing resistive segments into the feeding strips of PCAs, has to be evaluated in order to find suitable configurations. The design of an appropriate antenna structure is vital for achieving desired THz performance benchmarks. In this chapter, the design, simulation, and evaluation of such NiCr-modified antennas are presented. The reference H-Dipole geometry, first presented in  \cite{nandiErAsInAlGaAsPhotoconductors2021}, is introduced. The reference design is systematically modified by varying the NiCr feeds' configurations. Using CST
Studio Suite, surface current distributions and radiation impedances are analyzed to quantify how resistive
feeds influence both low-frequency resonance suppression and broadband THz performance.
