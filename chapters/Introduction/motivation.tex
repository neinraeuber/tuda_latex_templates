\begin{itemize}
    \item need for broadband 
    \item ringing: normale Lösung zB receiver und emitter mit unterschiedlichen strip längen --> hier: commercial detector --> wir brauchen keine unterschiedlichen längen, weil wir es auch so schaffen, das ringing zu verhindern !
\end{itemize}

With an increasing number of applications the demand for efficient THz devices is steadily increasing. THz technology is rapidly advancing, enabling new applications in fields like healthcare, telecommunications, and security. As hardware improves, THz is poised to transform industries by enhancing data transmission, diagnostics, and integration with emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing \cite{shekariApplicationsTerahertzTechnology2025}. Developing more efficient, compact and cost-effective THz sources is vital. Current THz generation techniques, such as quantum cascade lasers and photoconductive antennas, have made progress but require further optimization for broader accessibility, especially in portable applications \cite{THzSecurityApplications}. 

Photoconductive antennas in particular play an essential role in bridging the microwave-photonics-gap.
