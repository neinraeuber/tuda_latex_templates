\chapter{Theory}
The underlying theory for understanding THz-TDS, the fundamentals of THz generation and detection and its challenges at low frequencies in pulsed systems are outlined in the following.

\chapter{Antenna Design and Simulation}

The design of an appropriate antenna structure is vital for achieving the desired bandwidth and THz performance. We use the design for a H-Dipole antenna proposed by Nandi Uttam \cite{nandiErAsInAlGaAsPhotoconductors2021} as our reference. From there, NiCr-sections in the antenna feeding strip are added. Different configurations are evaluated. CST Studio Suite is used for the simulations. Design considerations and simulation results are presented in the following.

\chapter{Device Fabrication and DC Characterization}
A semiconducting wafer that was already grown at the institute was chosen for its excellent photoconductive properties.

\textbf{TODO: name some properties, maybe get data from Florian}

The wafer needs to be cleaved into appropriate size before various processing steps can be performed. The fabrication process of the H-Dipole antennas that were proposed previously is described. The processed antennas are DC characterized to ensure suitability for usage in THz-TDS experiments.

\chapter{Results and Discussion}

\textbf{TODO: rework Intro}

The setup used for Measuring THz radiation using a pulsed system is presented in the following. Measurements of the proposed antennas are evaluated by analyzing anc comparing their transient behavior.
