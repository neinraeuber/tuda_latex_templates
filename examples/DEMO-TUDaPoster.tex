\section*{General information}

The document class tudaposter is part of the TUDa-CI bundle. It is for posters and non-scientific posters using TU Darmstadts Corporate Design.

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\subsection*{Usage}
	Basic usage is nearly identical to tudapub, as the titles are structured similarly.
	Like tudapub, the tudaposter class is based on \KOMAScript{}.
	This has the advantage that more can be used than would be necessary for a poster.

	tudaposter makes it possible to write continuous text.
	The tudasciposter class, which is based on tikzposter, cannot do this.

	\subsection*{Title}
	The title can be set with \code{\maketitle}.
	The macros \code{\title}, \code{\subtitle} and \code{\author} can be used here but also available are \code{\titlegraphic}, \code{\addTitleBox}, \code{\footerqrcode} and \code{\footer}. Except for \code{\footerqrcode} only the content is placed accordingly.
	An example of usage is shown in DEMO-TUDaPoster.tex.

	\subsection*{Specify lengths}
	Two length dimensions \texttt{\textbackslash{}contentwidth} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}contentheight} are predefined within the poster content (this also includes the title graphic).
	The height here is the distance between the title block and the footer/divider line.

	\subsection*{Document class options}
	\begin{description}
		\item[paper=<papersize>] Formats from A0 to A4 are supported. Default is a0.
		\item[fontsize=<fontsize/auto>] The base font size is defined here, so that the other sizes then scale accordingly. The default setting is \code{auto}. It is for scaling increments on supported paper sizes.
		\item[logo=head/body] The logo will appear in the header or within the document content.
		\item[color=<colorcode>] Accent color according to corporate design guidelines.
		\item[colorsubtitle=true/false] The background color for the subtitle can be switched on and off.
		\item[footer=true/false] Default is \code{false}.
		\item[marginpar=true/false] The width of marginpar is the width of the logo. This can be filled with \code{\tbs{}SetMarginpar} or \code{\tbs{}marginpar}. For more details see \file{DEMO-TUDaAnnouncement}.

		      The image that belongs to the title is overlapped with marginpar and therefore \code{marginpar=true} and \code{\tbs{}titlegraphic} should only be used carefully together.
		\item[title=large/small/default] Reduces the font size by one level. In this case \code{large} is \code{default} and \code{small} choose the title font size of the next smaller paper size where the base font size and marginpar stay the same.
		\item[type=default/announcement] Different layouts of posters can be loaded here.
		      \code{announcement} sets the options \code{marginpar=true,indenttext=false,logo=head,title=small,colorsubtitle=true} and also activates the output of the subtitle in bold font.
