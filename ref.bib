  abstract = {In this study, we utilized terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to study the radiation-induced protein deformation. The absorption coefficient spectra obtained from THz-TDS measurements in the frequency range (0.06--2 THz) was fitted using the Lorentzian model. The absorption coefficient fitting data was used to identify the {$\alpha$}-helix and {$\beta$}-structure relative contributions in the protein secondary structure of the kidney tissue of rats irradiated with 10-cGy and 2-Gy X-ray separately or in combination. Our data show that 2-Gy X-irradiation leads to an increase in the {$\beta$}-structure contribution associated with a decrease in the {$\alpha$}-helix contribution as indicated by the fitting parameters extracted from fitting the absorption coefficient {$\alpha$}({$\omega$}) spectra with the Lorentzian function. The results point out that there is a strong correlation between the strength of the hydrogen bonds located between or inside the polypeptide chains of the extended {$\beta$}-sheet and {$\alpha$}-helix, respectively, and the absolute value of the absorption coefficient {$\alpha$}({$\omega$}), the refractive index, and the dielectric constant. The lowest refractive index and dielectric constant are recorded in the 2-Gy-irradiated group followed by the 10-cGy--2~Gy-irradiated group while the least effect was recorded in the 10-cGy-irradiated group. These data provide evidence of the adaptive effect of the 10-cGy X-irradiation delivered 24~h prior to the 2-Gy x-irradiation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Terahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far infrared (100 GHz--{$\sim$}30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting, security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon               et al               2017               J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.               50               043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art, and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a `snapshot' introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of scientific research and commercial realisation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Efficient terahertz generation and detection are a key prerequisite for high performance terahertz systems. Major advancements in realizing efficient terahertz emitters and detectors were enabled through photonics-driven semiconductor devices, thanks to the extremely wide bandwidth available at optical frequencies. Through the efficient generation and ultrafast transport of charge carriers within a photo-absorbing semiconductor material, terahertz frequency components are created from the mixing products of the optical frequency components that drive the terahertz device~-- a process usually referred to as photomixing. The created terahertz frequency components, which are in the physical form of oscillating carrier concentrations, can feed a terahertz antenna and get radiated in case of a terahertz emitter, or mix with an incoming terahertz wave to down-convert to DC or to a low frequency photocurrent in case of a terahertz detector. Realizing terahertz photoconductors typically relies on short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors as the photo-absorbing material, where photocarriers are quickly trapped within one picosecond or less after generation, leading to ultrafast carrier dynamics that facilitates high-frequency device operation. However, while enabling broadband operation, a sub-picosecond lifetime of the photocarriers results in a substantial loss of photoconductive gain and optical responsivity. In addition, growth of short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors in many cases relies on the use of rare elements and non-standard processes with limited accessibility. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to explore and develop alternative techniques for realizing terahertz photomixers that do not rely on these defect-introduced short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. This review will provide an overview of several promising approaches to realize terahertz emitters and detectors without short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. These novel approaches utilize p-i-n diode junctions, plasmonic nanostructures, ultrafast spintronics, and low-dimensional materials to offer ultrafast carrier response. These innovative directions have great potentials for extending the applicability and accessibility of the terahertz spectrum for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful technique for material's characterization and process control. It has been used for contact-free conductivity measurements of metals, semiconductors, 2D materials, and superconductors. Furthermore, THz-TDS has been used to identify chemical components such as amino acids, peptides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives, which makes it particularly valuable for fundamental science, security, and medical applications. This tutorial is intended for a reader completely new to the field of THz-TDS and presents a basic understanding of THz-TDS. Hundreds of articles and many books can be consulted after reading this tutorial. We explore the basic concepts of TDS and discuss the relationship between temporal and frequency domain information. We illustrate how THz radiation can be generated and detected, and we discuss common noise sources and limitations for THz-TDS. This tutorial concludes by discussing some common experimental scenarios and explains how THz-TDS measurements can be used to identify materials, determine complex refractive indices (phase delay and absorption), and extract conductivity.},
