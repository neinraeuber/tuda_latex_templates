  abstract = {In this study, we utilized terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to study the radiation-induced protein deformation. The absorption coefficient spectra obtained from THz-TDS measurements in the frequency range (0.06–2 THz) was fitted using the Lorentzian model. The absorption coefficient fitting data was used to identify the α-helix and β-structure relative contributions in the protein secondary structure of the kidney tissue of rats irradiated with 10-cGy and 2-Gy X-ray separately or in combination. Our data show that 2-Gy X-irradiation leads to an increase in the β-structure contribution associated with a decrease in the α-helix contribution as indicated by the fitting parameters extracted from fitting the absorption coefficient α(ω) spectra with the Lorentzian function. The results point out that there is a strong correlation between the strength of the hydrogen bonds located between or inside the polypeptide chains of the extended β-sheet and α-helix, respectively, and the absolute value of the absorption coefficient α(ω), the refractive index, and the dielectric constant. The lowest refractive index and dielectric constant are recorded in the 2-Gy-irradiated group followed by the 10-cGy–2~Gy-irradiated group while the least effect was recorded in the 10-cGy-irradiated group. These data provide evidence of the adaptive effect of the 10-cGy X-irradiation delivered 24~h prior to the 2-Gy x-irradiation.},

Here we demonstrate that the use of plasmonic contact electrodes can significantly mitigate the low-quantum efficiency performance of photoconductive terahertz optoelectronics. The use of plasmonic contact electrodes offers nanoscale carrier transport path lengths for the majority of photocarriers, increasing the number of collected photocarriers in a subpicosecond timescale and, thus, enhancing the optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency of photoconductive terahertz emitters and the detection sensitivity of photoconductive terahertz detectors. We experimentally demonstrate 50 times higher terahertz radiation powers from a plasmonic photoconductive emitter in comparison with a similar photoconductive emitter with non-plasmonic contact electrodes, as well as 30 times higher terahertz detection sensitivities from a plasmonic photoconductive detector in comparison with a similar photoconductive detector with non-plasmonic contact electrodes.},

  abstract = {Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz–30 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to ‘real world’ applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.},

The radiation patterns of a double-slot antenna on a silicon dielectric lens are computed using ray-tracing inside the dielectric lens and electric and magnetic field integration on the spherical dielectric surface. The measured radiation patterns at 246 GHz and Gaussian-beam coupling efficiencies show good agreement with theory. The theoretical results are presented in terms of extension-length/radius and radius/ lambda , and therefore result in universal design curves for silicon lenses of different diameters and at different frequencies. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that for single units, there exists a wide range of extension lengths which result in high Gaussian-coupling efficiencies (50-60\%) to moderately high f 's. These Gaussian-coupling efficiencies can be increased to 80-90 degrees \% with the use of a lambda /sub m//4 matching-cap layer. For imaging array applications with high packing densities, an extension-length/radius of 0.38 to 0.39 (depending on frequency) will result in peak directivity and a corresponding Gaussian-coupling efficiency 15-20\% lower than for single units.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {A novel equivalent circuit for pulsed photoconductive sources is introduced for describing the coupling between the photoconductive gap and the antenna. The proposed circuit effectively describes the mechanism of feeding the antenna by the semiconductor when this latter is illuminated by a laser operating in a pulsed mode. Starting from the classical continuity equation, which models the free carriers density with respect to the laser power pump and the semiconductor features, a Norton equivalent circuit in the frequency-domain is derived. According to the Norton’s theorem, the equivalent source representation is decoupled from the antenna. In particular, for photoconductive antennas, the Norton circuit takes into account of the electrical and optical properties of the semiconductor material, the features of the laser excitation, as well as the geometrical dimensions of the gap. The presence of the electrodes around the gap is part of the antenna and, therefore, it is taken into account in the antenna impedance. The proposed circuit allows the analysis of the coupling between the photoconductive source and the antenna, providing a tool to analyze and design photoconductive antennas.},

Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon               et al               2017               J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.               50               043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art, and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a ‘snapshot’ introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of scientific research and commercial realisation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Efficient terahertz generation and detection are a key prerequisite for high performance terahertz systems. Major advancements in realizing efficient terahertz emitters and detectors were enabled through photonics-driven semiconductor devices, thanks to the extremely wide bandwidth available at optical frequencies. Through the efficient generation and ultrafast transport of charge carriers within a photo-absorbing semiconductor material, terahertz frequency components are created from the mixing products of the optical frequency components that drive the terahertz device~– a process usually referred to as photomixing. The created terahertz frequency components, which are in the physical form of oscillating carrier concentrations, can feed a terahertz antenna and get radiated in case of a terahertz emitter, or mix with an incoming terahertz wave to down-convert to DC or to a low frequency photocurrent in case of a terahertz detector. Realizing terahertz photoconductors typically relies on short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors as the photo-absorbing material, where photocarriers are quickly trapped within one picosecond or less after generation, leading to ultrafast carrier dynamics that facilitates high-frequency device operation. However, while enabling broadband operation, a sub-picosecond lifetime of the photocarriers results in a substantial loss of photoconductive gain and optical responsivity. In addition, growth of short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors in many cases relies on the use of rare elements and non-standard processes with limited accessibility. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to explore and develop alternative techniques for realizing terahertz photomixers that do not rely on these defect-introduced short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. This review will provide an overview of several promising approaches to realize terahertz emitters and detectors without short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. These novel approaches utilize p-i-n diode junctions, plasmonic nanostructures, ultrafast spintronics, and low-dimensional materials to offer ultrafast carrier response. These innovative directions have great potentials for extending the applicability and accessibility of the terahertz spectrum for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the impact of antenna dispersion on wideband Terahertz (THz) imaging systems. It is demonstrated that the effective bandwidth is reduced from the nominal system bandwidth, and thus, the expected image resolution cannot be reached when the antenna system has inappropriate frequency dispersion characteristics. Besides a theoretical analysis and simulations, experiments were conducted using antennas with different dispersion characteristics in an ultra-wideband 500–750 GHz imaging setup to assess the impact on achievable resolution. When utilizing low dispersion dielectric-lens antennas, the system successfully detected multiple targets with a radius of 0.6 mm even when positioned at close distance (2 mm in cross-range and 3 mm in range). In contrast to that, when using higher dispersion horn antennas, the resolution of a dual-target scenario was reduced to 3 mm in cross-range and 4 mm in range. Furthermore, it is shown that the target position reconstruction accuracy, as well as the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), are also improved by 68\% and 2.7 dB, respectively, when using low dispersion antennas in the same setup. This investigation, for the first time, highlights the importance of considering antenna dispersion for accurate image reconstruction, particularly for high-resolution wideband THz imaging systems.},

  abstract = {ErAs:In(Al)GaAs photoconductors have proven to be outstanding devices for photonic terahertz (0.1 THz-10 THz) generation and detection. These superlattices are composed of ErAs, InGaAs and InAlAs layers, grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. This thesis presents the so far most detailed material characterization of these photoconductor materials followed by an investigation of THz performance. The variation of the material properties as a function of the ErAs concentration and the superlattice structure is discussed for both emitter and receiver materials. Infrared spectroscopy shows an absorption coefficient in the range of 4700-6600 cm⁻¹  at 1550 nm, with shallow absorption edges towards longer wavelengths caused by absorption by ErAs precipitates. The carrier lifetime of the material was obtained using differential transmission measurements. The carrier dynamics also featured a bias-dependent bi-exponential decay, which has been described by a proposed theoretical modeling. Hall measurements show that samples with only 0.8 monolayers (ML) of compensation-doped ErAs precipitates (p-delta-doped at 5×10¹³ cm⁻²) with InAlAs spacer layer featured a carrier concentration of 3.6±0.4×10¹² cm⁻³ which is almost reaching the intrinsic carrier concentration of InGaAs. The IV characteristics featured a resistance in the range of \textasciitilde 10-20 MΩ and high breakdown field strengths beyond 100 kV/cm, corresponding to {$>$}500 V for a 50 μm electrode gap. With a higher ErAs concentration of 1.6 ML (2.4 ML) the resistance decreases by a factor of \textasciitilde 40 (120) for an otherwise identical superlattice structure. We further propose a theoretical model for the calculation of the excess current generated due to heating and for estimation of the photocurrent from the total illuminated current.  The THz performance has been investigated for all dedicated source material structures. TDS measurements and emitted THz power proves that In(Al)GaAs with 0.8 ML ErAs precipitates is suitable for fabricating high-performance THz devices. THz characterization shows that ErAs:InGaAs receivers are suitable for detecting high average THz power of \textasciitilde 14 mW with current responsivity in the range of 110±25 μA/√W, yet showing slight saturation. Investigation on the antenna performance showed that low frequency optimized 200 μm H-dipole antennas emits the maximum THz signal. Similarly, 50 μm H-dipole antennas used as receivers showed a higher THz peak-peak signal with enhancement of the low-frequency spectrum, whereas for 25 μm H-dipole receivers the spectrum was enhanced uniformly. These measurements were in line with the simulated radiation resistance of the antenna structures. The maximum THz peak-peak signal obtained was 1580 nA corresponding to approx. 113 dB peak dynamic range using source and receiver antenna combinations optimized around 0.2-1 THz where the peak of the spectrum occurs. Bandwidth-optimized antenna structures feature a bandwidth of 6.5 THz. A maximum THz power of 472±35 μW was emitted by low frequency optimized 200 μm H-dipole antenna using p-compensated 0.8 ML ErAs In(Al)GaAs photoconductor material. We finally make a comparison between the emitted THz signal for antenna emitter (AE) and large are emitter (LAE), operated under low laser power (45 mW). Antenna-coupled emitters enhance the overall emitted THz signal, with a maximum of 2.42-fold increase in the THz peak-peak signal corresponding to 12 dB higher dynamic range using 200 μm H-dipole antenna. A theoretical modelling had also been developed which supports these measured results.},

The feasibility of point-to-point stationary THz communication links has already been experimentally demonstrated. To build upon this breakthrough, one of the pressing research targets is making THz communication systems truly mobile. Achieving this target is especially complicated because mobile THz wireless systems (including WLANs and even cellular access) will often operate in the near-field due to the very large (even though physically small) electrical size of the high-gain antenna systems required for making high-rate communication links feasible at such frequencies. This perspective article presents several key prospective research challenges envisioned on the way to designing efficient mobile near-field THz wireless access as a part of 6G and 7G wireless landscapes.},

  abstract = {This review is focused on the latest developments in continuous-wave (CW) photomixing for Terahertz (THz) generation. The first part of the paper explains the limiting factors for operation at high frequencies\,∼\,1 THz, namely transit time or lifetime roll-off, antenna (R)-device (C) RC roll-off, current screening and blocking, and heat dissipation. We will present various realizations of both photoconductive and p-i-n diode–based photomixers to overcome these limitations, including perspectives on novel materials for high-power photomixers operating at telecom wavelengths (1550 nm). In addition to the classical approach of feeding current originating from a small semiconductor photomixer device to an antenna (antenna-based emitter, AE), an antennaless approach in which the active area itself radiates (large area emitter, LAE) is discussed in detail. Although we focus on CW photomixing, we briefly discuss recent results for LAEs under pulsed conditions. Record power levels of 1.5 mW average power and conversion efficiencies as high as 2\,×\,10−3 have been reached, about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those obtained with CW antenna-based emitters. The second part of the paper is devoted to applications for CW photomixers. We begin with a discussion of the development of novel THz optics. Special attention is paid to experiments exploiting the long coherence length of CW photomixers for coherent emission and detection of THz arrays. The long coherence length comes with an unprecedented narrow linewidth. This is of particular interest for spectroscopic applications, the field in which THz research has perhaps the highest impact. We point out that CW spectroscopy systems may potentially be more compact, cheaper, and more accurate than conventional pulsed systems. These features are attributed to telecom-wavelength compatibility, to excellent frequency resolution, and to their huge spectral density. The paper concludes with prototype experiments of THz wireless LAN applications. For future telecommunication systems, the limited bandwidth of photodiodes is inadequate for further upshifting carrier frequencies. This, however, will soon be required for increased data throughput. The implementation of telecom-wavelength compatible photomixing diodes for down-conversion of an optical carrier signal to a (sub-)THz RF signal will be required.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic waves centred at a frequency of 1 THz lie between photonics on the one hand and electronics on the other, and are very hard to generate and detect. However, since the THz part of the spectrum is energetically equivalent to many important physical, chemical and biological processes including superconducting gaps and protein dynamical processes, it is of great interest to facilitate experimental research in this region. This has stimulated major steps in the past decade for filling this gap in the usable spectrum. In this review paper we describe the evolution of a new generation of sources that boost the average power available in the THz region by more than a million-fold, making this region routinely accessible for the first time. This is achieved using two enhancement factors, namely relativistic electrons and super-radiance. We will also point to the scientific potential for discovery that is now enabled in this region.},

  abstract = {Terahertz (THz) waves are ranged between microwave and infrared region in the electromagnetic spectrum. THz technology has been demonstrated promising potential for biomedical applications. Exploration of biological effects of THz waves has emerged as a critical new area in life sciences. It is critical to uncover the effects of THz waves on complex biological systems in order to lay out the framework for THz technology development and future applications. Specifically, THz radiation has been shown to affect the nervous system, including the structure of nerve cell membranes, genes expressions, and cytokines level. In this review, we primarily discuss the biological impacts and mechanisms of THz waves on the nervous system at the organisms, cellular, and molecular levels. The future application perspectives of THz technologies in neuroscience are also highlighted and proposed., Radiation physics; Neuroscience; Biomedical engineering},

  abstract = {The application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) in the quantitative analysis of major minerals in Bayan Obo magnetite ore was explored. The positive correlation between the optical parameters of the original ore and its iron content is confirmed. The detections of three main iron containing minerals, including magnetite, pyrite, and hematite, were simulated using corresponding reagents. The random forest algorithm is used for quantitative analysis, and FeS2 is detected with precision of R2\,=\,0.7686 and MAE\,=\,0.6307\% in ternary mixtures. The experimental results demonstrate that THz-TDS can distinguish specific iron containing minerals and reveal the potential application value of this testing method in exploration and mineral processing fields.},
