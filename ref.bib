  abstract = {In this study, we utilized terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to study the radiation-induced protein deformation. The absorption coefficient spectra obtained from THz-TDS measurements in the frequency range (0.06–2 THz) was fitted using the Lorentzian model. The absorption coefficient fitting data was used to identify the α-helix and β-structure relative contributions in the protein secondary structure of the kidney tissue of rats irradiated with 10-cGy and 2-Gy X-ray separately or in combination. Our data show that 2-Gy X-irradiation leads to an increase in the β-structure contribution associated with a decrease in the α-helix contribution as indicated by the fitting parameters extracted from fitting the absorption coefficient α(ω) spectra with the Lorentzian function. The results point out that there is a strong correlation between the strength of the hydrogen bonds located between or inside the polypeptide chains of the extended β-sheet and α-helix, respectively, and the absolute value of the absorption coefficient α(ω), the refractive index, and the dielectric constant. The lowest refractive index and dielectric constant are recorded in the 2-Gy-irradiated group followed by the 10-cGy–2~Gy-irradiated group while the least effect was recorded in the 10-cGy-irradiated group. These data provide evidence of the adaptive effect of the 10-cGy X-irradiation delivered 24~h prior to the 2-Gy x-irradiation.},

  abstract = {Terahertz (THz) waves are non-ionizing radiations with unique properties of both microwave and infrared. THz imaging and spectroscopy have been widely used for non-destructive testing, security screening, medical imaging, and quality control both in the agricultural and food industries. This review briefly describes the principles of how THz is generated, discusses its current agricultural applications and highlights the research gaps. THz spectroscopy has primarily been used for measuring the water content of plant leaves. Later, it was used to detect dead and live insects and pests in agricultural products. A combination of THz spectroscopy with chemometric methods, machine learning, and search algorithms helped scientists to construct classification models for discrimination of transgenic seeds, pesticides, harmful compounds, and poisonous plants. THz spectroscopy has also been used for soil inspection and detection of heavy metals and buried objects. In recent years, there have been significant technological improvements in developing THz sources and detectors, which enabled researchers to perform ultra-fast scanning and obtain high-resolution images. Using these new THz technologies, researchers can differentiate between fresh and old leaves, monitor the water status of plants, and estimate the crop yield. Although THz has proved to be a useful tool for non-destructive quality control of agricultural products and soil inspection, the technique has some limitations such as a low limit of detection (LOD) for pesticides, low spatial resolution, and limited penetration. It can also be influenced by the physical properties of samples such as particle size, and surface roughness. On the sensor side, more research is needed to improve the performance of THz systems, reduce THz sensor costs and ruggedness of the system for applications in agriculture. Also, more research is required to explore new potential applications of this technology in agriculture.},

Here we demonstrate that the use of plasmonic contact electrodes can significantly mitigate the low-quantum efficiency performance of photoconductive terahertz optoelectronics. The use of plasmonic contact electrodes offers nanoscale carrier transport path lengths for the majority of photocarriers, increasing the number of collected photocarriers in a subpicosecond timescale and, thus, enhancing the optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency of photoconductive terahertz emitters and the detection sensitivity of photoconductive terahertz detectors. We experimentally demonstrate 50 times higher terahertz radiation powers from a plasmonic photoconductive emitter in comparison with a similar photoconductive emitter with non-plasmonic contact electrodes, as well as 30 times higher terahertz detection sensitivities from a plasmonic photoconductive detector in comparison with a similar photoconductive detector with non-plasmonic contact electrodes.},

A strong absorbance and refractive index increase was observed with the oxidation. A simple phenomenological fitting using a continuous distribution of oscillators reproduces the frequency dependence of the complex dielectric response as well as demonstrates quantitative agreement with a uniform increase in either mode density or polarizability with oxidation in the 5–80cm−1 frequency range. Hydration dependence measurements find that a difference in the equilibrium water content for ferri and ferro cytochrome c is not sufficient to account for the large change in terahertz response. The large dielectric increase at terahertz frequencies with oxidation suggests either a significant global softening of the potential and/or a significant increase in polarizability with oxidation.},

A review of the available literature led to the conclusion that the limitations inherent in the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits had not been adequately examined, and this led to the investigation that is reported on in this paper. The Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are useful in the reduction of the equivalent circuit for a transmitting-receiving antenna system to simpler networks that facilitate the evaluation of the received power. One finds in the literature that the calculated power dissipation within these equivalent circuits is often equated to the reradiated and scattered power from the receiving antenna. Such calculations are not correct, because power dissipation in the network from which the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits were obtained cannot be made using the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits. However, as we will show, the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits can be used to find a reradiated electromagnetic field that is a part of the total field scattered by a receiving antenna. As part of the derivation of this new result, we develop a derivation of the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits from the basic principles of uniqueness and superposition applied to electromagnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz–30 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to ‘real world’ applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.},

  abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation (0.1–10 THz) has demonstrated great significance in a wide range of interdisciplinary applications due to its unique properties such as the capacity to penetrate optically opaque materials without ionizing effect, superior spatial resolution as compared to the microwave domain for imaging or ability to identify a vast array of molecules using THz fingerprinting. Advancements in generation and detection techniques, as well as the necessities of application-driven research and industry, have created a substantial demand for THz-range devices and components. However, progress in the development of THz components is hampered by a lack of efficient and affordable characterization systems, resulting in limited development in THz science and technology. Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs) are highly sophisticated well-established characterization instruments in the microwave bands, which are now employed in the lower end of the THz spectrum (up to 1.5 THz) using frequency extender modules. These modules are extremely expensive, and due to the implementation of hollow metallic waveguides for their configuration, they are narrowband, requiring at least six modules to achieve a frequency coverage of 0.2–1.5 THz. Moreover, they are susceptible to problems like material losses, manufacturing and alignment tolerances etc., making them less than ideal for fast, broadband investigation. The main objective of this thesis is to design a robust but cost-effective characterization system based on a photonic method that can characterize THz components up to several THz in a single configuration. To achieve this, we design architectures for the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) concept, incorporating ErAs:In(Al)GaAs-based photoconductive sources and ErAs:InGaAs-based photoconductive receivers, driven with a femtosecond pulsed laser operating at 1550 nm. The broadband photonic devices replace narrowband electronic ones in order to record the Scattering (S)-parameters in a free space configuration. Corresponding calibration and data evaluation methods are also developed. Then the PVNAs are configured, and their capabilities are validated by characterizing various THz components, including a THz isolator, a  distributed Bragg Reflector, a Split-Ring Resonator array and a Crossed-Dipole Resonator (CDR) array, in terms of their S-parameters. The PVNAs are also implemented to determine the complex refractive index or dielectric permittivity and physical thickness of several materials in the THz range. Finally, we develop an ErAs:In(Al)GaAs-based THz transceiver and implement it in a PVNA configuration, resulting in a more compact setup that is useful for industrial applications. The feasibility of such systems is also verified by characterizing several THz components. The configured systems achieve a bandwidth of more than 2.5 THz, exceeding the maximum attainable frequency of the commercial Electronic Vector Network Analyzer (EVNA) extender modules. For the 1.1-1.5 THz band, the dynamic range of 47-35 dB (Equivalent Noise Bandwidth (ENBW) = 9.196 Hz) achieved with the PVNA is comparable to the dynamic range of 45-25 dB (ENBW = 10 Hz) of the EVNA. Both amplitude and phase of the S-parameters, determined by the configured PVNAs, are compared with simulations or theoretical models and showed excellent agreement. The PVNA could discern multi-peak and narrow resonance characteristics despite its lower spectral resolution (∼3-7 GHz) compared to the EVNA. By accurately determining the S-parameters of multiple THz components, the transceiver-based PVNA also demonstrated its exceptional competence.  With huge bandwidth and simpler calibration techniques, the PVNA provides a potential solution to bridge the existing technological gap in THz-range characterization systems and offers a solid platform for THz component development, paving the way for more widespread application of THz technologies in research and industry.},

  abstract = {Strong terahertz (THz) electric and magnetic transients open up new horizons in science and applications. We review the most promising way of achieving sub-cycle THz pulses with extreme field strengths. During the nonlinear propagation of two-color mid-infrared and far-infrared ultrashort laser pulses, long, and thick plasma strings are produced, where strong photocurrents result in intense THz transients. The corresponding THz electric and magnetic field strengths can potentially reach the gigavolt per centimeter and kilotesla levels, respectively. The intensities of these THz fields enable extreme nonlinear optics and relativistic physics. We offer a comprehensive review, starting from the microscopic physical processes of light-matter interactions with mid-infrared and far-infrared ultrashort laser pulses, the theoretical and numerical advances in the nonlinear propagation of these laser fields, and the most important experimental demonstrations to date.},

  abstract = {Thin film resistive materials with low temperature coefficients of resistance (TCR) and high sheet resistances are essential for various electronic applications, such as embedded resistors. In this study, Al inserting layers and NiCr resistive layers were sequentially deposited on alumina ceramic substrates via DC magnetron sputtering to fabricate Al/NiCr bilayer resistive materials. The electrical properties of the bilayer films were adjusted by varying the thicknesses of the Al inserting layers and annealing conditions. When the thickness of the Al inserting layer varied from 5 to 7.5 nm, and post-annealing treatments ranging from 200℃ to 400℃ were applied, evident Al-NiCr interdiffusion occurred, forming intermediate layers at the interfaces. A mixture of partial crystalline phases and amorphous phases was also observed in the cross-sectional TEM images. The formation of intermediate layers and the balance between partial crystalline phases and amorphous phases collectively enhanced the electrical performance of bilayer film resistors, achieving thin film resistors with a remarkably low TCR of -6.61 ppm/K and a sheet resistance of up to 265.95 Ω/sq. By rational design of Al layers, NiCr layers and thermal treatment, thin film resistors with near zero TCRs and extremely wide sheet resistance range of 93.34 to 1439.01 Ω/sq can be obtained.},

Since the THz power measurements are performed with a pyroelectric detector calibrated by the National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB), the experimentally obtained values are directly traceable to the International System of Units (SI) for the described conditions. The agreement between the presented model and the experimental results is excellent using only one fitting parameter. A very low NEP of 1.8 fW/Hz at 188.8 GHz is obtained at room temperature.},

The radiation patterns of a double-slot antenna on a silicon dielectric lens are computed using ray-tracing inside the dielectric lens and electric and magnetic field integration on the spherical dielectric surface. The measured radiation patterns at 246 GHz and Gaussian-beam coupling efficiencies show good agreement with theory. The theoretical results are presented in terms of extension-length/radius and radius/ lambda , and therefore result in universal design curves for silicon lenses of different diameters and at different frequencies. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that for single units, there exists a wide range of extension lengths which result in high Gaussian-coupling efficiencies (50-60\%) to moderately high f 's. These Gaussian-coupling efficiencies can be increased to 80-90 degrees \% with the use of a lambda /sub m//4 matching-cap layer. For imaging array applications with high packing densities, an extension-length/radius of 0.38 to 0.39 (depending on frequency) will result in peak directivity and a corresponding Gaussian-coupling efficiency 15-20\% lower than for single units.{$<>$}},

The proposed circuit effectively describes the mechanism of feeding the antenna by the semiconductor when this latter is illuminated by a laser operating in a pulsed mode. Starting from the classical continuity equation, which models the free carriers density with respect to the laser power pump and the semiconductor features, a Norton equivalent circuit in the frequency-domain is derived. According to the Norton’s theorem, the equivalent source representation is decoupled from the antenna. In particular, for photoconductive antennas, the Norton circuit takes into account of the electrical and optical properties of the semiconductor material, the features of the laser excitation, as well as the geometrical dimensions of the gap. The presence of the electrodes around the gap is part of the antenna and, therefore, it is taken into account in the antenna impedance. The proposed circuit allows the analysis of the coupling between the photoconductive source and the antenna, providing a tool to analyze and design photoconductive antennas.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Terahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far infrared (100 GHz–∼30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting, security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon               et al               2017               J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.               50               043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art, and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a ‘snapshot’ introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of scientific research and commercial realisation.},

  abstract = {The rotational and vibrational energy levels of numerous biomolecules lie in the terahertz (THz) band, which makes THz spectroscopy a viable option for biosensing and monitoring the chemical processes such as the formation of hydrogen bonds. However, classifying the fingerprint THz spectra of various molecules has constantly challenged real-world applications. Here, a machine learning model based on a discrete Gaussian process and maximum likelihood estimation (DGPML) for classifying an ensemble of 20 amino acids is proposed. The model demonstrates a prediction accuracy of 99.5\% in the presence of scattering noise and various experimental conditions and is able to distinguish spectra without significant absorption peaks. Compared to the conventional Gaussian process classifier, which generally exhibits less time and space complexity than neural-network models, DGPML requires 99\% less training time and achieves 1530 times faster processing speed with around 0.29 million parameters. Regarding the DGPML, a database that encloses the THz absorption spectrum and its covariance matrix, which describes the deviation of the absorption spectrum under various experimental conditions, is designed. Due to the compact size and high efficiency of the proposed model, it has the potential to power the THz chemical sensor in the future.},

The device is based on a dual-antenna architecture, in which a two-dimensional array of mid-infrared patch-antenna resonators is connected to the electrodes of a log-spiral terahertz antenna. By exploiting intersubband absorption inside an AlGaAs–GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructure, a photocurrent is coherently generated at the difference frequency between two quantum cascade lasers. The photocurrent drives the antenna electrodes allowing tunable, continuous-wave generation in free-space up to 1 THz at room temperature. By experimentally studying the photomixer frequency response and dark impedance, we demonstrate that the observed power roll-off at high-frequency is limited by the combined effect of the photoexcited carrier’s intrinsic lifetime and of the device RC time constant. In the spectral range investigated, we obtain, in continuous-wave, mid-infrared → terahertz conversion efficiencies exceeding by orders of magnitude those of unipolar devices exploiting χ(2) processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Efficient terahertz generation and detection are a key prerequisite for high performance terahertz systems. Major advancements in realizing efficient terahertz emitters and detectors were enabled through photonics-driven semiconductor devices, thanks to the extremely wide bandwidth available at optical frequencies. Through the efficient generation and ultrafast transport of charge carriers within a photo-absorbing semiconductor material, terahertz frequency components are created from the mixing products of the optical frequency components that drive the terahertz device~– a process usually referred to as photomixing. The created terahertz frequency components, which are in the physical form of oscillating carrier concentrations, can feed a terahertz antenna and get radiated in case of a terahertz emitter, or mix with an incoming terahertz wave to down-convert to DC or to a low frequency photocurrent in case of a terahertz detector. Realizing terahertz photoconductors typically relies on short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors as the photo-absorbing material, where photocarriers are quickly trapped within one picosecond or less after generation, leading to ultrafast carrier dynamics that facilitates high-frequency device operation. However, while enabling broadband operation, a sub-picosecond lifetime of the photocarriers results in a substantial loss of photoconductive gain and optical responsivity. In addition, growth of short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors in many cases relies on the use of rare elements and non-standard processes with limited accessibility. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to explore and develop alternative techniques for realizing terahertz photomixers that do not rely on these defect-introduced short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. This review will provide an overview of several promising approaches to realize terahertz emitters and detectors without short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. These novel approaches utilize p-i-n diode junctions, plasmonic nanostructures, ultrafast spintronics, and low-dimensional materials to offer ultrafast carrier response. These innovative directions have great potentials for extending the applicability and accessibility of the terahertz spectrum for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the impact of antenna dispersion on wideband Terahertz (THz) imaging systems. It is demonstrated that the effective bandwidth is reduced from the nominal system bandwidth, and thus, the expected image resolution cannot be reached when the antenna system has inappropriate frequency dispersion characteristics. Besides a theoretical analysis and simulations, experiments were conducted using antennas with different dispersion characteristics in an ultra-wideband 500–750 GHz imaging setup to assess the impact on achievable resolution. When utilizing low dispersion dielectric-lens antennas, the system successfully detected multiple targets with a radius of 0.6 mm even when positioned at close distance (2 mm in cross-range and 3 mm in range). In contrast to that, when using higher dispersion horn antennas, the resolution of a dual-target scenario was reduced to 3 mm in cross-range and 4 mm in range. Furthermore, it is shown that the target position reconstruction accuracy, as well as the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), are also improved by 68\% and 2.7 dB, respectively, when using low dispersion antennas in the same setup. This investigation, for the first time, highlights the importance of considering antenna dispersion for accurate image reconstruction, particularly for high-resolution wideband THz imaging systems.},

  abstract = {ErAs:In(Al)GaAs photoconductors have proven to be outstanding devices for photonic terahertz (0.1 THz-10 THz) generation and detection. These superlattices are composed of ErAs, InGaAs and InAlAs layers, grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. This thesis presents the so far most detailed material characterization of these photoconductor materials followed by an investigation of THz performance. The variation of the material properties as a function of the ErAs concentration and the superlattice structure is discussed for both emitter and receiver materials. Infrared spectroscopy shows an absorption coefficient in the range of 4700-6600 cm⁻¹  at 1550 nm, with shallow absorption edges towards longer wavelengths caused by absorption by ErAs precipitates. The carrier lifetime of the material was obtained using differential transmission measurements. The carrier dynamics also featured a bias-dependent bi-exponential decay, which has been described by a proposed theoretical modeling. Hall measurements show that samples with only 0.8 monolayers (ML) of compensation-doped ErAs precipitates (p-delta-doped at 5×10¹³ cm⁻²) with InAlAs spacer layer featured a carrier concentration of 3.6±0.4×10¹² cm⁻³ which is almost reaching the intrinsic carrier concentration of InGaAs. The IV characteristics featured a resistance in the range of \textasciitilde 10-20 MΩ and high breakdown field strengths beyond 100 kV/cm, corresponding to {$>$}500 V for a 50 μm electrode gap. With a higher ErAs concentration of 1.6 ML (2.4 ML) the resistance decreases by a factor of \textasciitilde 40 (120) for an otherwise identical superlattice structure. We further propose a theoretical model for the calculation of the excess current generated due to heating and for estimation of the photocurrent from the total illuminated current.  The THz performance has been investigated for all dedicated source material structures. TDS measurements and emitted THz power proves that In(Al)GaAs with 0.8 ML ErAs precipitates is suitable for fabricating high-performance THz devices. THz characterization shows that ErAs:InGaAs receivers are suitable for detecting high average THz power of \textasciitilde 14 mW with current responsivity in the range of 110±25 μA/√W, yet showing slight saturation. Investigation on the antenna performance showed that low frequency optimized 200 μm H-dipole antennas emits the maximum THz signal. Similarly, 50 μm H-dipole antennas used as receivers showed a higher THz peak-peak signal with enhancement of the low-frequency spectrum, whereas for 25 μm H-dipole receivers the spectrum was enhanced uniformly. These measurements were in line with the simulated radiation resistance of the antenna structures. The maximum THz peak-peak signal obtained was 1580 nA corresponding to approx. 113 dB peak dynamic range using source and receiver antenna combinations optimized around 0.2-1 THz where the peak of the spectrum occurs. Bandwidth-optimized antenna structures feature a bandwidth of 6.5 THz. A maximum THz power of 472±35 μW was emitted by low frequency optimized 200 μm H-dipole antenna using p-compensated 0.8 ML ErAs In(Al)GaAs photoconductor material. We finally make a comparison between the emitted THz signal for antenna emitter (AE) and large are emitter (LAE), operated under low laser power (45 mW). Antenna-coupled emitters enhance the overall emitted THz signal, with a maximum of 2.42-fold increase in the THz peak-peak signal corresponding to 12 dB higher dynamic range using 200 μm H-dipole antenna. A theoretical modelling had also been developed which supports these measured results.},

We illustrate how THz radiation can be generated and detected, and we discuss common noise sources and limitations for THz-TDS.

The feasibility of point-to-point stationary THz communication links has already been experimentally demonstrated. To build upon this breakthrough, one of the pressing research targets is making THz communication systems truly mobile. Achieving this target is especially complicated because mobile THz wireless systems (including WLANs and even cellular access) will often operate in the near-field due to the very large (even though physically small) electrical size of the high-gain antenna systems required for making high-rate communication links feasible at such frequencies. This perspective article presents several key prospective research challenges envisioned on the way to designing efficient mobile near-field THz wireless access as a part of 6G and 7G wireless landscapes.},

In a photomixing experiment, the laser frequencies are far above the cut-off frequency of the photomixer, and only the time average of its contribution is detected. The chapter provides the presentation of an electrical model of a THz source based on photomixing in photodetectors. One kind of semiconductor device that can be used as photomixer is the pn junction photodiode. The chapter shows that the two main geometrical parameters of a fast photodetector, namely the thickness of the photoconductive layer and the inter-electrode spacing are fixed by the optical absorption depth in the photoconductive material to about 2 μm. In the THz range, the standard rectangular metallic waveguides are lossy and integration with a photodetector can be very challenging.},

  abstract = {This review is focused on the latest developments in continuous-wave (CW) photomixing for Terahertz (THz) generation. The first part of the paper explains the limiting factors for operation at high frequencies\,∼\,1 THz, namely transit time or lifetime roll-off, antenna (R)-device (C) RC roll-off, current screening and blocking, and heat dissipation. We will present various realizations of both photoconductive and p-i-n diode–based photomixers to overcome these limitations, including perspectives on novel materials for high-power photomixers operating at telecom wavelengths (1550 nm). In addition to the classical approach of feeding current originating from a small semiconductor photomixer device to an antenna (antenna-based emitter, AE), an antennaless approach in which the active area itself radiates (large area emitter, LAE) is discussed in detail. Although we focus on CW photomixing, we briefly discuss recent results for LAEs under pulsed conditions. Record power levels of 1.5 mW average power and conversion efficiencies as high as 2\,×\,10−3 have been reached, about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those obtained with CW antenna-based emitters. The second part of the paper is devoted to applications for CW photomixers. We begin with a discussion of the development of novel THz optics. Special attention is paid to experiments exploiting the long coherence length of CW photomixers for coherent emission and detection of THz arrays. The long coherence length comes with an unprecedented narrow linewidth. This is of particular interest for spectroscopic applications, the field in which THz research has perhaps the highest impact. We point out that CW spectroscopy systems may potentially be more compact, cheaper, and more accurate than conventional pulsed systems. These features are attributed to telecom-wavelength compatibility, to excellent frequency resolution, and to their huge spectral density. The paper concludes with prototype experiments of THz wireless LAN applications. For future telecommunication systems, the limited bandwidth of photodiodes is inadequate for further upshifting carrier frequencies. This, however, will soon be required for increased data throughput. The implementation of telecom-wavelength compatible photomixing diodes for down-conversion of an optical carrier signal to a (sub-)THz RF signal will be required.},

  abstract = {Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is one of the most powerful techniques to characterise the far infrared response of materials and devices. Based on the use of short electromagnetic waveforms generated by rectifying femtosecond optical pulses delivered by a mode-locked laser, it allows, within one single experiment, the determination of the optical constants of materials over a wide frequency spectrum ranging from 100~GHz up to several THz. Thanks to its large dynamics and its ability to give both amplitude and phase of the transmitted, reflected or scattered THz fields, this technique addresses a large panel of scientific studies. In this chapter, one introduces the principles of THz-TDS. First, the characteristics and performances of a classical set-up are described, then the extraction of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the studied device from its complex experimental transmission or reflection coefficients are explained. As a demonstration of the power of this technique, one presents some results of thin film spectroscopy and recent studies of left-handed metamaterials. Finally, a detailed analysis of the precision of determined optical constants is given. One will treat not only the classical transmission scheme, but also the reflection regime that is mandatory in the study of strongly absorbing media.},

  abstract = {Terahertz (THz) continuous wave (CW) spectroscopy systems can offer extremely high spectral resolution over the THz band by photo-mixing high-performance telecommunications-band (1530-1565 nm) lasers. However, typical THz CW detectors in these systems use narrow band-gap photoconductors, which require elaborate material growth and generate relatively large detector noise. Here we demonstrate that two-step photon absorption in a nano-structured low-temperature grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) metasurface which enables switching of photoconductivity within approximately one picosecond. We show that LT-GaAs can be used as an ultrafast photoconductor in CW THz detectors despite having a bandgap twice as large as the telecommunications laser photon energy. The metasurface design harnesses Mie modes in LT GaAs resonators, whereas metallic electrodes of THz detectors can be designed to support an additional photonic mode, which further increases photoconductivity at a desired wavelength.},

  abstract = {The electrical and structural properties of AuGeNi ohmic contact to n-GaAs have been studied. A combination of EDX and X-ray diffraction analysis was used to examine the reactions between AuGeNi-based metallization and GaAs. Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) was used to study surface morphology and surface roughness. By the use of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA), contact resistivity as low as 5.5×10−8Ωcm2 have been obtained. The minimum in the contact resistivity coincides with the formation of AuGa and NiAs phases. On the other hand, poor thermal stability after contact formation was concluded to be due to the formation of low melting point AuGa phases. Formation of dark particles, recognized as GeNi particles, in different distributions and shapes after annealing, was found to be essential for low contact resistivity. Correlation between GeNi particles distribution and contact resistivity was found and introduced as d/λ parameter. It was found that the lower the size of these particles (d) as well as the larger the contact area over which they are distributed (λ) leading to the better contact resistivity.},

The transmitter operation is based on the repetitive, subpicosecond laser excitation of a Hertzian dipole antenna embedded in a charged coplanar line. With this transmitter electromagnetic beams of 1/2 cycle THz pulses at a repetition rate of 100 MHz are produced. The associated optoelectronic receiver is gated in synchronism with the excitation of the transmitter by subpicosecond pulses from the same laser source. With this receiver, the 10-nW beams of THz pulses were observed with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10000:1. Several sources contributing to the noise of the receiver are discussed, together with ways to reduce them. With an integration time of 125 ms, a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 is obtained for a THz beam with an average power of 10/sup -16/ W. The receiver operates in the sampling mode and has a time resolution of 0.5 ps.{$<>$}},

We have used terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to measure the full dielectric function of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose and the disaccharide sucrose in the frequency range 0.5-4.0 THz (16-130 cm(-1)). In polycrystalline sugars we observe a series of distinct absorption lines originating from the lowest intermolecular vibrational modes, whereas in amorphous sugars a broad, featureless absorption spectrum is observed. Our measurement of an anomalous temperature dependence of the absorption line positions in both protonated and deuterated sucrose shows that the effective potential of the weakest intermolecular vibrational modes in sucrose is determined by a balance between the hydrogen bond strength and van der Waals forces.

A comprehensive study of the far-infrared properties of polymers yet reveals that THz spectroscopy is a very convenient technology for the investigation of various material properties including the morphology. Here, we report the dielectric parameters refraction index n and absorption coefficient κ of various polymers determined by THz time-domain spectroscopy with a very high precision. The observed features are attributed to macromolecular origin. Furthermore, we show that the temperature-dependent lattice mode shifts of highly-crystalline polymers reveal information about thermo-morphological interactions between the amorphous and the crystalline phase. A temperature-dependent refractometric data base of various standard polymers completes the paper. This data base enables the determination of the glass transition temperature Tg of these polymers and allows the extrapolation of the index of refraction across a broad range of temperatures above and below Tg for a given material.},

However, since the THz part of the spectrum is energetically equivalent to many important physical, chemical and biological processes including superconducting gaps and protein dynamical processes, it is of great interest to facilitate experimental research in this region. This has stimulated major steps in the past decade for filling this gap in the usable spectrum. In this review paper we describe the evolution of a new generation of sources that boost the average power available in the THz region by more than a million-fold, making this region routinely accessible for the first time. This is achieved using two enhancement factors, namely relativistic electrons and super-radiance. We will also point to the scientific potential for discovery that is now enabled in this region.},

These are foil gauges glued onto the surface of the strainable member. The use of glue can, in some instances, limit both the degree of strain transmission from member to gauge and the temperature at which the device may be used. The use of thin film technology is seen as a way of obviating both these limitations.},
